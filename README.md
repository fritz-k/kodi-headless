# Introduction
A headless, dockerized Kodi instance for a shared MySQL setup to allow having a webinterface and automatic periodic library updates without the need for a player system to be permanently on.

# Prerequisites
You need to have set up library sharing via a dedicated MySQL database beforehand by reading, understanding and executing the necessary steps in the [MySQL library sharing guide](http://kodi.wiki/view/MySQL).

WARNING - as already stated in the wiki but here once again: Every client must run the same version of Kodi!

Best way to set up library sharing in the container is by fully configuring your shared library, its sources and scrapers via another GUI host (e.g. your HTPC) and setting up the Kodi headless instance afterwards.
The server needs fully configured database access and your sources (SMB or NFS) must be reachable from the headless instance.
All updating, scraping and cleaning can then be handled automatically by the headless Kodi instance on its own.

REMINDER: If you are not using TMDB/TVDB scrapers you need to take care of installing and enabling the respective plugins in the container yourself.

# Usage

Get the container image:
```bash
docker pull milaq/kodi-headless:leia
```

Run the container and set necessary environment variables:
```bash
docker run -d --restart=always --name kodi-headless -e KODI_DBHOST=<MY_KODI_DBHOST> -e KODI_DBUSER=<MY_KODI_DBUSER> -e KODI_DBPASS=<MY_KODI_DBPASS> milaq/kodi-headless:leia
```

If you want to map the webinterface ports natively then also append:
```bash
-p 8080:8080 -p 9090:9090
```

If eventserver access is also required outside of the container:
```bash
-p 9777:9777
```

Container environment variables:

* `KODI_DBHOST` - MySQL database host address (required)
* `KODI_DBUSER` - MySQL user for Kodi (required)
* `KODI_DBPASS` - MySQL password for Kodi user (required)
* `KODI_UPDATE_INTERVAL` - How often to scan for library changes on remote sources in seconds (optional, default is 300 [5 minutes])
* `KODI_CLEAN` - Whether to clean up the library periodically [`true`/`false`] (optional, requires sources.xml to be present)
* `KODI_CLEAN_INTERVAL` - How often to clean up the library in seconds (optional, default is 86400 [1 day])

## Automatic library cleaning

If you want to enable automatic library cleaning you HAVE to create an appropriate sources.xml (or grab a copy from you main HTPC)
```bash
/config/userdata/sources.xml
```
inside the container volume directly or reference a copy on the docker host, e.g.:
```bash
-v /path/to/sources.xml:/config/userdata/sources.xml
```
and enable library cleaning via the respective flag:
```bash
-e KODI_CLEAN=yes
```

__WARNING__: A misconfigured sources.xml can lead to the Kodi instance not finding any of your media which will result in emtpying your database. Make a backup of your database and/or be double sure of the sources.xml before enabling this feature!

## Custom advancedsettings.xml

If you want to supply a custom advancedsettings.xml, make sure the file is readable by uid 10000 and mount it read-only, e.g.:
```bash
-v /path/to/advancedsettings.xml:/config/userdata/advancedsettings.xml:ro
```
See advancedsettings.xml.default for the container's defaults. Make sure to add appropriate values for
```xml
<videodatabase>
    ...
</videodatabase>
<musicdatabase>
    ...
</musicdatabase>
```
as `KODI_DBHOST`, `KODI_DBUSER` and `KODI_DBPASS` can't be applied when the file is read-only.

Thanks goes out to linuxserver.io for creating a solid base of a dockerized Kodi version to work with.
More thanks goes to Celedhrim for creating the initial headless patch and sinopsysHK for the new headless patch since Leia.
